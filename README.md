# Mitsubishi MA Touch Thermostat BLE plugin for Homebridge

This is a very early but generally working Mitsubishi MA Touch thermostat integration for Homebridge. It currently requires that the PIN code be set the same for all available thermostats. Thermostats will be discovered automatically.

Currently this is tested on a Mac and a Raspberry Pi 4B, but should work on other platforms.
