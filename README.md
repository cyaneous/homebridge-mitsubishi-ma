# Mitsubishi MA Touch BLE plugin for Homebridge

This is a very early but generally working Mitsubishi MA Touch integration for Homebridge. It requireas that the PIN code be set the same for all available MA Touch thermostats and will automatically detect them.

Currently this is tested on a Mac and a Raspberry Pi 4B, but should work on other platforms.
